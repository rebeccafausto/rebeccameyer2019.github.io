      <p>The pineapple (Ananas comosus) is a tropical plant with edible fruit. It is a member of the Bromeliaceae family. Pineapples are indigenous to South America. Pineapple plants can withstand both drought and rainfall between 500 mm and 3,000 mm per annum. Pineapples are cultivated from a crown cutting of the fruit of the plant.</p>

<p>Until the mid-1990s, pineapple production and trade was dominated by the Smooth Cayenne variety, which is characterised by high sugar and acid content and which is well suited to canning. In the mid-1990s, Del Monte experimented with a new hybrid pineapple variety, MD2, which has an even sweeter taste, higher vitamin C content and a longer shelf life.</p>

<p>The MD2 variety has now replaced Smooth Cayenne pineapples as the preferred variety in every major market. Over 80% of all European imports are MD2. Most other pineapples are of the types ‘Smooth Cayenne’, ‘Sugarloaf’, and ‘Victoria’. In general pineapples for fresh consumption weigh between 1 and 2.5 kg.</p>
      
      <li id="ol-li">Product Specification</li>
        <h4>Quality</h4>
        <p>Pineapples are divided into three classes: Extra Class, Class I and Class II. Most pineapples sold in the European market are Class I or Extra Class.</p>
        <p>Information on the quality requirements for each class can be found in the:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>UNECE standards for pineapples</li>
          <li>standard for pineapples in the Codex Alimentarius, the ‘food code’ of the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO)</li>
          <li>General Marketing Standards of Regulation (EU) No. 543/2011.</li>
        </ul>
      <p>At the very least, pineapples should be:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>intact, with or without crown, which if present may be reduced or trimmed</li>
        <li>sound, i.e. produce affected by rotting or deterioration, such as to make it unfit for consumption, is excluded</li>
        <li>clean, practically free of any visible foreign matter</li>
        <li>practically free from pests</li>
        <li>free from damage caused by pests affecting the flesh</li>
        <li>fresh in appearance</li>
        <li>free of abnormal external moisture</li>
        <li>free of any foreign smell and/or taste.</li>
       </ul> 
      
      <p>The development and condition of the pineapples must be such as to enable them to withstand transportation and handling.</p>
      <p>The European quality standards in Regulation (EC) No. 1580/2007 specify that imports of fresh fruits and vegetables from third countries to the European Union (EU) must conform to the EU Marketing Standards or their equivalent.</p>
      <p>Pineapples do not ripen after harvesting. Exposure to ethylene produced by other fruits (for example bananas) may soften the fruit, but it will not make them any sweeter.</p>
      <h4>Size and packaging</h4>
      <p>Fresh pineapples are classified according to Size Codes A–H, with average weights (including the crown) ranging from 2750 grams (Size A) to 800 grams (Size H). The minimum weight for a pineapple is 700 grams, except for some small-size varieties, which may weigh less. See the Codex Alimentarius Standard for Pineapples.</p>
      <p>Packaging requirements differ by customer and market segment. Buyers require new, clean, high-quality packaging that ensures proper protection for the produce. Talk to your customers about their requirements and preferences concerning packaging. General characteristics include the following features:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Wholesale packaging in carton boxes or crates which can vary in size.</li>
        <li>Most fresh pineapples are packed in boxes containing 5–10 pineapples, with approximately 12 kilo net weight.</li>
      </ul>
